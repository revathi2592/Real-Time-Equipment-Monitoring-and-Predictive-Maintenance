**Real Time Equipment Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance**

Welcome to the Real-Time Equipment Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance project, created by Revathi Mani as an individual participant. This project demonstrates a robust solution for monitoring equipment health and anticipating maintenance needs using the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.

The solution is designed to handle real-time streaming data, leveraging Change Data Capture (CDC) from Azure Database for PostgreSQL as the source of live equipment data. This streaming data flows into an EventStream within Microsoft Fabric, where itâ€™s directed to a KQL database hosted on Event House. OneLake availability is then enabled, creating a Lakehouse shortcut to this dataset and establishing the Bronze layer in a medallion architecture.

The Bronze layer serves as a raw data repository, ready for transformation and refinement. Data is subsequently processed into the Silver layer, where a PySpark notebook cleanses and renames columns for a structured dataset. This Silver table is then utilized to create snapshot tables at hourly, daily, and monthly intervals, enabling different levels of data aggregation.

Finally, the Bronze layer and aggregated tables power detailed reporting that provides a device status summary, trends in status changes, and monitors key metrics like vibration levels and temperature. This real-time insight helps identify potential issues, predict equipment faults, and proactively plan maintenance.

**Prerequisites**

To setup project you need
